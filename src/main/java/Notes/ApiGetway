It provides a Single entry point to access all microservices.
And this Single Entry Point, provides lot of benefits like:

Microservices challenge: Each service exposes its own API. Without a gateway, clients must know and call each service directly,
                         which becomes complex as services grow.

Gateway solution: Provides a unified interface so clients don’t need to manage multiple endpoints.

Benefits:

Simplifies communication: Clients talk to one endpoint.

Improves security: Centralized authentication, authorization, and SSL termination.

Optimizes performance: Caching, load balancing, and request aggregation.

Adds resilience: Circuit breakers, retries, and fallback mechanisms.
