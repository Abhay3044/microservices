An HTTP client : is the standard protocol for communication between clients and servers on the web.
    1.Request Creation : Client builds an HTTP request with method, headers, and optional body.
    2.Request Sending: Sent over a TCP connection (often secured with TLS for HTTPS).
    3.Server Response: Status code, Headers , Body (actual data: HTML, JSON, XML, etc.).

Spring boot communications:
    1.Synchronous : Client wait for response from server before continuing. Blocking in nature.
        1.RestTemplate
        2.RestClient
        3.feignClient
    2.Asynchronous:
        1.webClient
Without spring boot way communication it uses HttpURLConnection:
    1.TooMuch Boiler plate code
    2. Response should be handled manually.
    3.Limited support for Advance features.

 Spring boot way :
    1. RestTemplate: restTemplate.getForObject("http://localhost:8080/products"+id,String.class);
        same as manually setting the connections .
        other methods : getForEntity and many more.
        Limitations : so many overloaded methods .no advance methods like retry and circuit breakers etc.

    2.RestClient: Modern fluent bases API (chaining of methods)
        1.one template for all different operations:
            String response  = restClient
            .get()
            .uri("http://localhost:8082/products" +id)
            .retrieve()
            .body(String.class)

    3.FeignClient : Declarative("What to do not how to do") HTTP client developed by Netflix.
        available by spring-cloud-starter-open-feign &  provide all modern seamless integrations
        i.Interface annotated with  @FeignClient(name = "product-service", url= "${feign.client.product.url")
        ii.@GetMapping("/product/{id}") // simple like controller.
            String getProductById(@PathVariable("id") String id);
        iii. @EnableFeignClients -> by this spring boot starts searching feign interfaces.
        @Autowire Interface class obj -> Implemented by feign
