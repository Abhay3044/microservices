Fault Tolerance : A mircoService is fault tolerance if continues to work even when downstream system fails.
                  Instead of crashing it handles the failure gracefully.

  TO Avoid fault Tolerance Resilience4j combination of mechanism comes in picture.
   RateLimiter -> Bulkhead -> TimeLimiter -> CircuitBreaker -> Retry

add dependency -> Resilience4j-spring-boot3;

1. RateLimiter : It Controls the number of requests allowed to a microservice in a given time window.(protects system form DDOS attack).
    Algo's:
    1.Fixed window counter
    2.Sliding log
    3.sliding window counter
    4. Token buket
    5.LeakyBucket

2.Bulkhead : helps to control how many concurrent requests go to downstream service.
    1.Semaphore bulkhead
    2.Thread-pool bulkhead

3.TimeLimiter

4. Retry : used for Transient issues -> short issues like network issue, timeouts,
    1. Retry of the same request after a short delay can get succeed.
    2. user @Retry annotation ->
    3.eg fixed retry or exponential retry.

5.Circuit Breaker: @CircuitBreaker(name "service name", fallbackMethod = " fallback")
    This pattern prevents an application to make repeated calls to a downstream service that is likely to fail.
    Prevents from: unnecessary call to downstream service(which leads to slow recovery)
                   Caller service(client) wastes resources an calling downstream service.

    States:
        1.Closed : All calls are allowed to downstream service.
        2.Open  : No calls are allowed to downstream service. fail the calls immediately.
        3.Half Open: Allows only limited number of test calls to downstream and keep track of their success rate.


    fallback : this method always called when failure is attempted.
